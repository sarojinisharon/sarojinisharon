## Publications

### **Detection of Skin Disease in Pervasive Healthcare Using CNN**  
**June 2023 – September 2023**  
This project involves using a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** in pervasive healthcare to detect skin diseases from images. Various **Keras** optimizers were compared, and the most accurate one was employed to predict skin abnormalities, enhancing detection efficiency.

### **Prediction of Mammogram Mass as Benign or Malignant**  
This paper compares various **supervised machine learning** techniques, including **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **KNN**, **Naive Bayes**, **SVM**, **Logistic Regression**, and a neural network, to the "mammographic masses" dataset. Using **10-fold cross-validation**, the study aims to identify the most accurate model, with **data preprocessing**, **normalization**, and **hyperparameter tuning** applied to improve performance.
